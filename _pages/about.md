<p>Hola &#128075;</p>
I am a final-year PhD Candidate in Operations Research at MIT, working with [Georgia Perakis](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/gperakis/). My research focuses on retail operations management, integrating principles from operations management, optimization, and machine learning to address the complexities of the retail sector. I am particularly interested in studying how the retailer's optimal policies are impacted by different factors such as complementarity and substitution cross-item effects, and  manager and customer behavior.

Prior to MIT, I worked for five years in industry as a Data Scientist in the areas of marketing mix modeling, attribution, retail location analytics, and fintech. My academic background includes Bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as a Master's degree in Data Science and Statistics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Madrid, Spain. 

**I am on the Fall 2024 Academic Job market!** I will be at INFORMS 2024:
- I am co-chairing the session *Summit-339: Revenue Management: from theory to practice* together with Georgia Perakis on Sunday, October 20, 12:45 PM - 2:00 PM and presenting on that session at 1:45 PM.
- I am presenting during session *Summit-444: Data Analytics and Technology in Operations Management* on Tuesday, October 22, 4:00-4:15 PM.

My research interests include:
- Retail Operations Management
- Optimization
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
