Hola! I am a final-year PhD Candidate in Operations Research at MIT, working with Georgia Perakis. My research focuses on retail operations management, integrating principles from operations management, optimization, and machine learning to address the complexities of the retail sector. I am particularly interested in studying how the retailer's optimal policies are impacted by different factors such as complementarity and substitution cross-item effects, and  manager and customer behavior.

Prior to MIT, I worked for five years in industry as a Data Scientist in the areas of marketing mix modeling, attribution, retail location analytics, and fintech. My academic background includes Bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as a Master's degree in Data Science and Statistics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Madrid, Spain. In my spare time, I enjoy playing padel tennis and squash, running, and traveling.

**I am on the Fall 2024 Academic Job market!** I will be presenting at INFORMS 2024 during 

My interests include:
- Retail Operations Management
- Optimization
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
